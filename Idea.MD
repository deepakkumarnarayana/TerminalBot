My Use Case: 

I want to create a bot that can interact with the terminal and perform actions based on the user's input.

Problem : I am using fedora and I want to do a troubleshooting of my system. then my bot use ai to get terminal and execute commands to get the system information and then analyze it and give me a repoert and suggest to kill process if it taking more resources.

suppose I want to check if a specific process is running or not then i need to remember the commands and check if the process is running or not.

suppose I want to check status of a service and see if it is running or not and it's failed then check log and see what is the issue.

like this if we use linux we need to remember lot of commands and check lot of files to get the information and analyze it.

from network troubleshooting to system troubleshooting to application troubleshooting we need to remember lot of commands and check lot of files to get the information and analyze it.

so i want to create a bot that can interact with the terminal and perform actions based on the user's input.

which utlize llm or local small model to get the information and analyze it.
